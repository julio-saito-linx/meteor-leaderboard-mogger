### Here are some ideas to get you started:

- [ ] Make a button that toggles between sorting by score and sorting by name. Hint: use a Session variable to hold the current sort choice.

- [ ] Make a button that resets everyone's score to a random number. (There is already code to do this in the server startup code. Can you factor some of this code out and have it run on both the client and the server?)

- [ ] Implement a way to add and remove scientists from the leaderboard.
